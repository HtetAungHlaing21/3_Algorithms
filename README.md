Filtering, Aggregation and Sorting Algorithms in Python

Description

This respository contains filtering, aggregating and sorting algorithms implemented in Python programming language. The algorithms are written in dynamic, robust and clean code. The algorithms are achieved only using fundamental Python syntax, without using lambda calculus, list comprehensions or any other imported libraries like NumPy.

Data Structures

The algorithms are tested using complex data structures, in the form of a list of dictionaries. The example dataset can be found in the code as well. More examples are written in comments.

1. Filtering algorithm

   The filtering algorithm filters the data from the given dataset by the filtering key. The filtering key and the filtering data are asked to the user and the algorithm returns the filtered data which meets a certain requirement.

2. Aggregating algorithm

   The aggregating algorithm takes the aggregation key from the user and provides the mean of a given factor.
   PS: If the user gives the key which is not possible to find the mean (Eg; Name or Address), the error message will be shown to the user.

3. Sorting algorithm

   The sorting algorithm takes the sorting factor from the user and provides the data in the ascending order sorted by that factor.
